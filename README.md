# Styled Checkbox

This is an example of customizing the standard [CUBA](https://www.cuba-platform.com/) UI components via CSS.

  - The `StyledCheckBoxExample.java` screen controller sets an HTML caption to `com.vaadin.ui.CheckBox` which is obtained by unwrapping the `CheckBox` component.
  - The `modules/web/themes/halo/halo-ext.scss` file contains the CSS code for the component.

To see the example in action, do the following:

  - Open the project in Studio
  - Click *Run* > *Start application* server
  - If you see the warning *Database does not exist* ..., click *Create DB in background*
  - Go to `http://localhost:8080/app` and log in as `admin / admin`
  - Open *Application* > *Styled checkbox example*.

Based on CUBA Platform 6.1.4
